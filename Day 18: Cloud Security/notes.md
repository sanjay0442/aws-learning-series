1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Cloud Security?

Cloud Security refers to the policies, technologies, and controls used to protect:

Data

Applications

Infrastructure
in cloud computing environments such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud (GCP).

It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of resources hosted in the cloud.

| Principle           | Description                                    | Example                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Confidentiality** | Protect data from unauthorized access          | IAM, encryption, MFA                  |
| **Integrity**       | Ensure data is accurate and not tampered       | Hashing, versioning, checksums        |
| **Availability**    | Ensure services and data are always accessible | Load balancers, auto-scaling, backups |

3Ô∏è‚É£ The Shared Responsibility Model (Applies to All Clouds)

| Security Area              | Cloud Provider (AWS/Azure/GCP) | You (Customer) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Physical Security          | ‚úÖ                              | ‚ùå              |
| Network Infrastructure     | ‚úÖ                              | ‚ùå              |
| Virtualization Layer       | ‚úÖ                              | ‚ùå              |
| Operating System           | ‚ùå                              | ‚úÖ              |
| Applications               | ‚ùå                              | ‚úÖ              |
| Identity & Access (IAM/AD) | ‚ùå                              | ‚úÖ              |
| Data & Encryption Keys     | ‚ùå                              | ‚úÖ              |
| Security Configuration     | ‚ùå                              | ‚úÖ              |

üí° Key Idea:
The provider secures the cloud infrastructure, while you secure everything inside it.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Core Pillars of Cloud Security

üîê Identity & Access Management

Control who can access what.

Implement least privilege using:

  AWS IAM / Azure AD / GCP IAM
  
  MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
  
  Role-based access control (RBAC)
  
  Temporary credentials instead of static keys

**üîè Data Protection**

  Encryption in Transit ‚Üí TLS/SSL
  
  Encryption at Rest ‚Üí KMS / Key Vault / Cloud KMS
  
  Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to prevent sensitive data leaks
  
  Backups and snapshots for resilience

**üß± Network Security**

Segmentation using:

  AWS: VPCs + Security Groups + NACLs
  
  Azure: VNets + NSGs
  
  GCP: VPC Networks + Firewall Rules

Use Private Subnets for backend systems

VPN / Direct Connect / ExpressRoute for secure hybrid access

**‚öôÔ∏è Monitoring & Threat Detection**

Continuous monitoring and logging:

  AWS: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, GuardDuty
  
  Azure: Monitor, Sentinel
  
  GCP: Security Command Center

Centralized alerts and anomaly detection

**üß© Compliance & Governance**

Align with standards: ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2

Use compliance dashboards:

  AWS Security Hub
  
  Azure Compliance Manager
  
  GCP Assured Workloads

Enable logging for auditing and incident response

| Security Category | AWS                     | Azure                  | GCP                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Identity          | IAM                     | Azure AD               | Cloud IAM                  |
| Encryption        | KMS                     | Key Vault              | Cloud KMS                  |
| Monitoring        | CloudWatch / CloudTrail | Monitor / Activity Log | Cloud Monitoring / Logging |
| Threat Detection  | GuardDuty               | Defender for Cloud     | Security Command Center    |
| Compliance        | Security Hub            | Compliance Manager     | Assured Workloads          |
| Network Security  | VPC SG/NACL             | VNet + NSG             | VPC Firewall Rules         |

6Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices for Cloud Security

‚úÖ Use MFA for all privileged users
‚úÖ Rotate access keys regularly
‚úÖ Enable CloudTrail / Activity Logs in all regions
‚úÖ Encrypt all data (S3, RDS, EBS, etc.)
‚úÖ Use private endpoints instead of public IPs where possible
‚úÖ Apply least privilege permissions
‚úÖ Enable GuardDuty / Defender / SCC for continuous threat detection
‚úÖ Schedule automated backups and snapshots
‚úÖ Review IAM policies periodically
‚úÖ Use security groups instead of allowing open ports (0.0.0.0/0)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Analogy

Think of cloud security like renting an apartment:

  The building security (doors, guards, fire systems) = Cloud Provider
  
  Your apartment locks, cameras, valuables = You (Customer)
  Both must be secure for full safety.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Recap

üå©Ô∏è Cloud Security applies across AWS, Azure, GCP

üîê CIA Triad is the foundation

‚öôÔ∏è Shared Responsibility defines who secures what

üîè Encryption, IAM, and Monitoring are key

üìä Use provider-native tools for detection & compliance
