# ‚ò∏Ô∏è Day 17: Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) ‚Äì Theory Notes

## üß† What is Amazon EKS?

**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** is a **fully managed Kubernetes service** by AWS.  
It allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes **without having to install or maintain the control plane (master nodes)**.

In short:
> EKS = Managed Kubernetes on AWS.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Use EKS?

Kubernetes is powerful but complex to set up ‚Äî EKS simplifies this by:
- Automatically managing Kubernetes **control plane & etcd database**
- Integrating with AWS services (EC2, Fargate, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch)
- Ensuring high availability and auto-scaling
- Providing **security, patching, and upgrades** automatically

---

## üß© Core Components of EKS

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Control Plane** | Managed by AWS. Handles scheduling, scaling, and API requests. |
| **Worker Nodes** | Your EC2 or Fargate instances where containers actually run. |
| **EKS Cluster** | The main Kubernetes cluster environment that connects all resources. |
| **Node Group** | A collection of EC2 instances registered as worker nodes. |
| **kubectl** | Command-line tool to interact with your EKS cluster. |
| **IAM Roles** | Used to control permissions for cluster and worker nodes. |
| **VPC** | Networking layer for pods, services, and node communication. |

---

## üß† How EKS Works (Simplified Flow)

1. You **create an EKS cluster** (AWS sets up control plane).
2. You **create worker nodes** (EC2 or Fargate).
3. Nodes **register** with the cluster.
4. You **deploy applications** using Kubernetes manifests (YAML files).
5. **EKS manages scaling, networking, and updates** automatically.

## üèóÔ∏è EKS Architecture Overview

| AWS Cloud (EKS)                            |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| Control Plane (Managed by AWS)             |
| - API Server                               |
| - etcd Database                            |
| - Scheduler, Controller Manager            |
| ----------------------------------------   |
| Worker Nodes (EC2/Fargate)                 |
| - kubelet                                  |
| - kube-proxy                               |
| - Pods / Containers                        |
| +----------------------------------------+ |


‚úÖ You manage the **nodes & pods**, AWS manages the **control plane**.

---

## üåê EKS Networking (VPC Integration)

EKS integrates deeply with your AWS VPC:
- Each **pod** gets its own **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**.
- Network traffic between pods and services stays **inside your VPC**.
- You can use **Security Groups** and **NACLs** to control access.

---

## üîê EKS Security Overview

| Security Layer | AWS Service / Concept |
|----------------|------------------------|
| IAM Roles | Control who can access the cluster (RBAC + IAM integration) |
| Security Groups | Define inbound/outbound rules for worker nodes |
| Secrets Manager | Store Kubernetes secrets securely |
| AWS WAF & Shield | Protect exposed applications |
| CloudTrail | Track API calls made to EKS |

---

## üöÄ EKS Deployment Models

1. **EKS on EC2**
   - You manage and maintain the EC2 worker nodes.
   - Best for custom configurations and workloads needing full control.

2. **EKS on Fargate**
   - Serverless option ‚Äî no need to manage EC2 nodes.
   - AWS handles provisioning and scaling containers.

3. **EKS Anywhere**
   - Deploy Kubernetes clusters on-premises or other clouds.
   - Useful for hybrid environments.

## ‚öñÔ∏è EKS vs ECS (Quick Comparison)

| Feature | ECS | EKS |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Type | AWS proprietary container orchestration | Kubernetes-based orchestration |
| Control Plane | Managed by AWS | Managed by AWS |
| Compatibility | AWS-only | Kubernetes standard (multi-cloud) |
| Learning Curve | Easier | Steeper |
| Customization | Limited | Highly flexible |
| Use Case | Simple container workloads | Complex microservices architecture |

---

## üîÑ EKS Lifecycle Management

| Action | Tool / Command |
|--------|----------------|
| Create Cluster | AWS Console / CLI / eksctl |
| Connect Cluster | `aws eks update-kubeconfig` |
| Deploy Apps | `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` |
| Monitor Logs | CloudWatch |
| Scale Pods | `kubectl scale` |
| Delete Cluster | `eksctl delete cluster` |

---

## üß∞ Tools Commonly Used with EKS

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **eksctl** | Simplified CLI tool for creating/managing EKS clusters |
| **kubectl** | Kubernetes CLI for interacting with clusters |
| **Helm** | Package manager for Kubernetes (deploy apps easily) |
| **CloudFormation / Terraform** | Automate EKS infrastructure setup |
| **CloudWatch** | Monitor cluster logs and metrics |

---

## üìã Common EKS Use Cases

- Microservices-based applications
- Machine Learning workloads
- CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes
- Hybrid or multi-cloud deployments
- Real-time streaming and data analytics apps
