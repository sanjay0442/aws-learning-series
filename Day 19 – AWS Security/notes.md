# üõ°Ô∏è Day 19: AWS Security (Theory)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to AWS Security
AWS Security is built around the **shared responsibility model** ‚Äî  
AWS secures the **infrastructure**, while **you (the customer)** secure everything *inside* your AWS environment (data, access, configurations, etc.).

AWS provides a wide range of **security services** and **best practices** that help protect your workloads from threats and maintain compliance.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Security Workflow Example

Here‚Äôs how a typical **AWS Security Architecture** ties together:

1. **IAM + SSO** ‚Üí Controls access  
2. **GuardDuty + Inspector** ‚Üí Detects vulnerabilities or intrusions  
3. **CloudTrail + Config** ‚Üí Logs and monitors all activities  
4. **Security Hub** ‚Üí Centralizes findings and compliance alerts  
5. **KMS + Secrets Manager** ‚Üí Encrypts and manages sensitive data  
6. **WAF + Shield** ‚Üí Protects public-facing applications  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Enable MFA** for all IAM users (especially root)  
‚úÖ **Never use root credentials** for daily operations  
‚úÖ **Rotate IAM access keys** regularly  
‚úÖ **Enable CloudTrail in all regions**  
‚úÖ **Use IAM roles** instead of embedding credentials in apps  
‚úÖ **Restrict S3 buckets** (no public access unless required)  
‚úÖ **Encrypt all data** (EBS, RDS, S3, etc.) using KMS  
‚úÖ **Enable GuardDuty and Security Hub**  
‚úÖ **Use least privilege** principle in IAM policies  
‚úÖ **Use AWS Config** to detect misconfigurations  
‚úÖ **Patch EC2 instances** regularly using Systems Manager Patch Manager

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Scenario

Imagine you run a web application on AWS:

- You secure login access using **Cognito + IAM roles**  
- Protect the frontend via **WAF + CloudFront**  
- Store data in **S3 with SSE-KMS encryption**  
- Monitor activity via **CloudWatch + CloudTrail**  
- Detect threats via **GuardDuty**  
- Get centralized compliance alerts via **Security Hub**  
- Regularly scan vulnerabilities with **Inspector**

Result ‚Üí You‚Äôve achieved **defense in depth** üîê ‚Äî multiple layers of protection.
