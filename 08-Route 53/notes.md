# üåç Day 08 ‚Äì AWS Route 53 (DNS & Traffic Management)

---

## üß† What is Route 53?

**Amazon Route 53** is a **highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service** by AWS.

It connects **user requests (like example.com)** to **AWS resources** (like EC2, S3, CloudFront, or Load Balancers).

---

## üí° Why the Name ‚ÄúRoute 53‚Äù?

- ‚ÄúRoute‚Äù = routing traffic  
- ‚Äú53‚Äù = the **default DNS port** (TCP/UDP port 53)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Purpose

Route 53 helps you:
1. **Register domains** (like `mywebsite.com`)  
2. **Route Internet traffic** to AWS services (EC2, S3, ALB, CloudFront, etc.)  
3. **Perform health checks** and route only to healthy endpoints  
4. **Manage multi-region traffic** for global users

---

## üèóÔ∏è Key Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Domain Registration** | You can buy domains directly from AWS (like a GoDaddy alternative). |
| **Hosted Zone** | A container that holds all DNS records for your domain (like example.com). |
| **Record Sets** | Individual DNS records that define how traffic is routed. |
| **Health Checks** | Monitors endpoint health and helps in failover routing. |

---

## üß© Understanding DNS Basics

When a user types:

https://www.example.com


1. The DNS resolver checks Route 53.  
2. Route 53 translates the domain name to an **IP address** (e.g., `54.213.25.7`).  
3. The browser connects to that IP to load the website.

---

## üß± Types of DNS Records in Route 53

| Record Type | Description | Example |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **A (Address)** | Maps a domain to an IPv4 address | `example.com ‚Üí 192.0.2.1` |
| **AAAA** | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address | `example.com ‚Üí 2001:db8::1` |
| **CNAME (Canonical Name)** | Maps one name to another | `www.example.com ‚Üí example.com` |
| **MX (Mail Exchange)** | Routes email to mail servers | `example.com ‚Üí mail.example.com` |
| **TXT** | Stores text data (SPF, DKIM, verification) | `"v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all"` |
| **NS (Name Server)** | Lists the authoritative name servers for the hosted zone | `ns-102.awsdns-20.com` |
| **SOA (Start of Authority)** | Holds admin info about the domain | Default AWS config |
| **Alias Record** | AWS-specific record type that routes traffic to AWS resources (no IP needed) | `example.com ‚Üí ALB / S3 / CloudFront` |

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Alias vs CNAME

| Feature | Alias | CNAME |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Supported for root domain (`example.com`) | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| AWS integration | ‚úÖ Native (ALB, S3, CloudFront, etc.) | ‚ùå Not supported |
| Cost | Free queries | Standard query charge |

---

## üß≠ Hosted Zones

There are two types of hosted zones:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Public Hosted Zone** | Used for domains accessible on the Internet | `mywebsite.com` |
| **Private Hosted Zone** | Used inside a VPC for internal DNS resolution | `internal.mycompany.local` |

---

## üåé Route 53 Routing Policies

Routing policies decide **how Route 53 responds** to DNS queries.

| Policy Type | Description | Use Case |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Simple Routing** | Returns a single record | For single web server setups |
| **Weighted Routing** | Distributes traffic based on weights (%) | A/B testing or blue-green deployments |
| **Latency-Based Routing** | Routes users to the region with lowest latency | Improve speed for global users |
| **Failover Routing** | Routes to a backup when primary fails | Disaster recovery setups |
| **Geolocation Routing** | Routes based on user‚Äôs physical location | Country/region-specific content |
| **Geoproximity Routing** | Routes based on user location **and** bias rules | Custom control over region routing |
| **Multivalue Answer Routing** | Returns multiple healthy records randomly | Basic load balancing without ELB |

---

## üí° Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | Routing Policy | Explanation |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Single EC2 website | Simple | One web server handles all traffic |
| Blue-Green deployment | Weighted | 80% traffic ‚Üí v1, 20% ‚Üí v2 |
| Multi-region web app | Latency-based | Route India users to Mumbai region |
| DR setup | Failover | Primary (Mumbai), Backup (Singapore) |
| Regional site access | Geolocation | Indian users ‚Üí india.example.com |
| Basic load balancing | Multivalue | Return multiple healthy IPs |

---

## üß† How Route 53 Works (Flow Diagram)

User Request ‚Üí Route 53 ‚Üí DNS Resolution ‚Üí AWS Resource (EC2/S3/ALB)


Example:

User enters www.example.com

Route 53 returns IP of Application Load Balancer

ALB routes traffic to healthy EC2 instances


---

## üîç Route 53 Health Checks

- Monitors endpoint health using HTTP/HTTPS/TCP.  
- Can be associated with routing policies (like failover).  
- Example:  
  - Primary EC2 health check fails ‚Üí Route 53 automatically switches traffic to backup EC2.

---

## üîê Route 53 with Private Hosted Zone

Used inside a **VPC** for **internal DNS resolution**, such as:
- `db.internal.local`
- `app.internal.local`

Only resources **inside the VPC** can resolve it.

---

## üß∞ Route 53 Integrations

| Service | Integration |
|----------|--------------|
| **EC2** | Map instance or ALB DNS name |
| **S3** | Route traffic to static website bucket |
| **CloudFront** | Use for CDN endpoints |
| **ELB / ALB** | Alias record for load balancer |
| **RDS** | Use CNAME for database endpoints |
| **CloudWatch** | Monitor DNS query metrics and health checks |

---

## üßæ Example Record Set

| Name | Type | Value | Routing |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| `example.com` | A | Alias ‚Üí ALB DNS | Simple |
| `www.example.com` | CNAME | example.com | Simple |
| `api.example.com` | A | Alias ‚Üí API Gateway | Weighted |
| `db.example.com` | CNAME | rds-db-endpoint.aws.com | Simple |

---

## üß© Route 53 Pricing (Simplified)

| Service | Typical Cost |
|----------|---------------|
| Hosted Zone | $0.50 per month per zone |
| Standard Queries | $0.40 per million |
| Health Checks | $0.50 per month each |
| Alias Queries to AWS | Free |
